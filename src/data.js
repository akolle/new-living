    shortDesc: `Best-tasting water we have had to date! Best Feature- multi-levels of different filtration target many impurities`,
    longDesc: `We actually purchased a ZeroWater pitcher for our cat with Chronic Kidney Disease.  We didn’t want her kidneys straining to filter out extra toxins and heavy metal.  Our town water is pretty good on its own, but I do notice increased chlorine smells and it’s very hard water.  This system uses 5 stages of filtration and has certifications to back it up.  It takes a few minutes for the water to flow through the filter, so we try to keep it full.   We couldn’t afford a full-house RO system, plus this is renter friendly.  We go through one filter every 6-7 weeks using water for two adults, two cats, and one large dog.  I buy the 12 or 16-pack replacements, which averages about $10 a month.`,
